# Github pages for Jingnan Jia

This academic website repository is cloned from https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io.

## How to set the configeration?

Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see this set of diffs showing what files were changed to set up an example site for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
(Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the markdown_generator folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

## directory introduction
0. File `_config.yml` is used to config the website.
7. Directory `_pages` stores the content shown on the main website.
1. The files in `_publications` and `_talks` could be generated by `markdown_generator`, but not necessary. I think 
changing the files directly is easier.
2. Directory `files` stores `.pdf` or any other files which may be cited by `publichation` or `talks` or `CV`.
3. Directory `_includes`, `_layouts`, `_sass` and `assets` are not known yet.
4. Directory `_teaching` ?
5. Directory `_posts` contains the posts. But how to show/dis-show them on the main page?
6. Directory `_portfolio` ?
8. Directory `_data`:
    1. File `navigation.yml` config the main parts shown on the main web. This is **very important!**
    2.
