I tried a lot of methods to correct the comment part but all failed.
    1. ask friends, no one know it.
    1. Ask taobao, they do not know it after 1 hour.
    1. By myself, I made it worse. 
So I need to roll back!

### How to make github roll back to previous commit?
1. Github desktop (I downloaded it, but it did not work and I found its functions have been achieved by Pycharm)
2. Pycharm has the 'force push' button but it is grayed out. How to fix it?
    1. [Force push is disabled only for protected branches](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-226503#:~:text=Force%20push%20is%20disabled,Settings%20%7C%20Version%20Control%20%7C%20Git). master is protected by default. The list can be configured in Settings | Version Control | Git.
